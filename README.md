# Credit Risk Modelling – Python Project

*A full-cycle credit risk modelling project applying statistical and machine learning techniques to estimate Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD).*

**🔍 Project Overview**

This project analyzes borrower-level credit data to develop predictive risk models. The goal is to understand which financial and behavioural factors contribute to default risk and expected credit loss. The project includes:

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Logistic and linear regression models
- Model diagnostics and evaluation
- Interpretation of risk drivers

**🛠 Tech Stack**

**Python**

- pandas for data wrangling and preprocessing
- numpy for numerical operations
- scikit-learn for logistic and linear regression models
- statsmodels for statistical modelling and significance testing
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

**🧩 Key Contributions**

- Cleaned and prepared borrower datasets, including handling missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions.
- Developed three IRB-style models: PD Model, LGD Model, EAD Model
- Performed statistical testing and model diagnostics to validate feature significance.
- Evaluated model performance using ROC curves, AUC, R² scores, and calibration metrics.
